# Machine Learning Virtual Painter Project
This project allows you to draw in the air using your hand gestures. The project uses computer vision and hand tracking to detect hand movements and finger gestures. Based on the gestures, the program identifies the drawing color and shape, allowing you to create unique artworks.

# Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- PyAutoGUI
- CVZone (HandTrackingModule)

# Usage
- Clone or download the project files.

- Install the required packages using the following command:

``pip install opencv-python numpy pyautogui cvzone``
- Navigate to the project directory and run the script:
``python virtual_painter.py``

- Hold your hand in front of the camera and start drawing in the air.
